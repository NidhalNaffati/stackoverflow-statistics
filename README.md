# _Stack overflow Statistics_

Welcome to the **Stack overflow Statistics** project. <br/>
The project is a web application that provides statistics about the Stack Overflow website. <br/>
We use real data from the Stack Overflow website via the Stack Exchange API to provide statistics about the website. <br/>
We are storing just the questions for the past week and performing some analysis on them like the most used viewed questions, the most scored questions, the number of questions related to a specific programming language, etc. <br/>


## Introduction
The Stack Overflow website is a question and answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers. <br/>
So I have decided to build a web application that provides statistics about the Stack Overflow website. <br/>
We use real data from the Stack Overflow website via the Stack Exchange API to provide statistics about the website. <br/>
We are storing just the questions for the past week and performing some analysis on them like the most used viewed questions, the most scored questions, the number of questions related to a specific programming language, etc. <br/>
At the moment our related programming languages are:
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* C#
* C++
* PHP
* Ruby
* Go
* Swift
* Kotlin

We are storing only the questions for the past week so it can be easy to provide so charts. <br/>
We are using the following charts:
* Bar chart
* Pie chart
* Line chart
* Doughnut chart

We are also providing scheduled tasks to update the questions since the questions can be even closed, answered, getting more votes, etc. <br/>
We are also providing scheduled tasks to store more questions. <br/>

Here is a video series that shows up the project:
